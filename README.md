# Quantization series

1. Quantization of Neural Networks, Part 1

   Starting from goals of quantizatio, where we can run quantized DNNs, basic terms, definitions and simple examples.
   This creates fundamentals for our next episode where we will dive deeper into specific quantization algorithms and will apply them to DNNs!
